Sited on the promenade that lines the shore of the French Quarter, this squat white building – an unmissable landmark – offers some of the best sea-facing seats you’re going to get. 
The food isn’t anything to write home about, but this is an allowance we’re willing to make to soak in the calming sound of waves crashing against the rocky shore. 
Get here early for sunrise or sunset (the café is open 24x7); it’s often full up. Order a cup of coffee, fire up your Instagram, and get ready to capture those gorgeous, #nofilterneeded views.

Address: No 40, Goubert Avenue, Near Gandhi Statue, French Quarter, Pondicherry 605002</centre:align><strong></em>
