    I am <strong>Tanya!</strong><em>studying B.Tech chemical from VIT University, I have worked as a trainee in Leading MNCs such as BCG, KPMG,
    Although I am from a Non-CS background but I have a basic knowledge in
    <ol> C++ 
        JAVA
        Python
        Cloud computing.
    </ol>
    <center>
    Being an undergraduate
    chemical engineer, I keep a desire to go in the energy and environmental sector. So, the unique thing about me is my creativity, 
    its quite an easy goal to acquire knowledge about a topic but it's not everyone's cup of tea to bring creativity in a job, assigned.
    Apart from the academic things, I keep an interest in badminton, kabbadi, sketching, travelling, playing synthesizer, singing. 
    So! thats all folks! 
    Stay tuned to know more about me.
    
    Thanks for checking!
